# Creamlinux
CreamApi clone for Linux. Updated fork of https://github.com/Rosentti/creamlinux.

## Support
This should work for any linux native steam title that doesn't block LD_PRELOAD.

## Tested games
 - Hearts Of Iron IV
 - Stellaris (doesn't work anymore :< )
 - PAYDAY 2
 
## Usage 
0. You will need the actual files for DLC in the game. Creamlinux does not and _will not_ auto-download anything. 
1. Download the [latest](https://github.com/20PercentRendered/creamlinux/releases/latest/download/creamlinux.zip) release of Creamlinux.
2. Unzip it and copy the files to the game's directory
3. Set the game's steam launch params to `sh ./cream.sh %command%`.
4. If you have your own cream_api.ini, copy the DLC lines to Creamlinux's cream_api.ini in the game directory. 
5. Launch your game and have fun! 

## Build Dependencies

3. Copy `output` folder contents to the game folder.
